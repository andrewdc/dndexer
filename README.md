# Warning, this is a work in progress and a proof of concept

So don't use it until this notice goes away, cause it will probably be broken, or just flat out suck.

You should know, I'm mostly building this for myself, so that I can quickly print out cards for DMing. ;) If it turns into something useful for anyone else - there shall be much rejoicing.
